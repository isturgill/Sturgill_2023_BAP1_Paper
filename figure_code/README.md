# Figure code

The figure code is uploaded here as an R markdown (Rmd) file and as a simplified R script with the Rmd text commented out. \
Due to Github file size limit constraints, data used in the Rmd are hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10180501) as **data.zip**.

> [!Note]
To run Rmd code, first extract data.zip. Extracted data folder and Rmd must be in the same directory for the Rmd to run. 
Users will also need to ensure that they have all R packages installed. A knit PDF version of the Rmd is included for convenience. 
At the end of the PDF is a print-out of the runtime sessionInfo for package versions, repeated below:
